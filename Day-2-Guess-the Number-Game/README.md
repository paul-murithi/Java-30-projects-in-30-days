#### 1. **Project Overview**

- **Objective**: Build a console-based game where the player guesses a randomly generated number within a specified range.

#### 2. **Learning Goals**

- **Java Basics**: Improve understanding of syntax, data types, and basic constructs.
- **Control Structures**: Utilize loops and conditionals to manage game flow.
- **User Input**: Learn to handle and validate user input effectively.
- **Randomness**: Get comfortable with generating random numbers.
- **Game Design**: Think through simple game mechanics and user interaction.

#### 3. **Project Breakdown**

- **Step 1: Project Setup**

  - Create a new Java project and main class.

- **Step 2: Random Number Generation**

  - Implement logic to generate a random number (e.g., between 1 and 100).

- **Step 3: User Input Handling**

  - Use a method to gather user input and validate that it is a number within the specified range.

- **Step 4: Game Loop**

  - Create a loop that allows the player to keep guessing until they guess correctly.
  - Provide feedback based on the player's guesses (too high, too low, correct).

#### 4. **Potential Enhancements**

- Add features like:
  - Limiting the number of guesses.
  - Keeping track of high scores.
  - Allowing different ranges or difficulty levels.
