For your "Prime Number Finder" project, here's what is expected:

### Overview:

The goal is to create a program that can determine if a number is prime and potentially find all prime numbers within a given range.

### Key Features:

1. **Prime Checking Logic**:

   - Implement a method that checks whether a number is prime. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

2. **User Input**:

   - The program should prompt the user to input a number (or range) to check if it is prime.

3. **Error Handling**:

   - Handle invalid input (e.g., negative numbers, non-integers) and provide appropriate feedback to the user.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - Your algorithm should efficiently determine if a number is prime. This includes iterating only up to the square root of the number for divisor checks.

### Optional Twists for a Challenge:

- Allow the user to input a range and return all prime numbers within that range.
- Add a timer to see how long it takes to compute prime numbers.
- Enhance the user interface with additional output (like the total count of prime numbers found).
