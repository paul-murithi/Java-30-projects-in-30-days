### **Project Overview:**

- **Objective**: Create a program that checks whether a given word, phrase, or sentence is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

### **Core Features**:

1. **User Input**:
   - The program should prompt the user to input a word, phrase, or sentence.
2. **Palindrome Logic**:

   - The program must determine if the input is a palindrome by comparing the characters from the beginning and the end of the string, ignoring case, spaces, and punctuation.

3. **Case Insensitivity**:

   - The checker should be case-insensitive (i.e., "Madam" and "madam" should both be valid palindromes).

4. **Handling Non-alphanumeric Characters**:

   - Your program should ignore spaces, punctuation, and special characters (e.g., commas, periods, exclamation points) when checking for a palindrome.

5. **Output**:
   - The program should output whether the input is a palindrome or not. You can provide a simple message like "Yes, it’s a palindrome" or "No, it’s not a palindrome."

### **Optional Enhancements**:

- **Multiple Input Types**: Allow the user to check multiple inputs (either words or entire sentences) in a single run.
- **Edge Case Handling**: Handle edge cases, such as an empty string or strings with only non-alphanumeric characters (e.g., "!!!").

### **User Experience**:

- Clear and concise prompts for user input.
- Clean and meaningful output, making it easy for the user to understand whether their input was a palindrome.
