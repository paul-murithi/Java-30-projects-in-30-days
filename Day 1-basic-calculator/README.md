### Project Description

This Java project implements a basic calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. Users can input two numbers and select an operation, and the calculator will display the result.

### How to Use

1. **Compile the code:**
   ```bash
   javac App.java
   ```

2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java App
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts:**
   * Enter the first number.
   * Choose an operation (+, -, *, /).
   * Enter the second number.
   * The calculator will display the result.

### Example Usage

```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): +
Enter the second number: 5
The result is: 15
```

### Code Structure
The `Calculator.java` file contains the following:

* **Input validation:** Checks for invalid input (e.g., non-numeric values, division by zero).
* **Operation selection:** Prompts the user to choose an operation.
* **Calculation:** Performs the selected operation on the input numbers.
* **Output:** Displays the result.

### Potential Enhancements
* **Error handling:** Implement more robust error handling for invalid input.
* **Advanced calculations:** Add support for more complex calculations (e.g., square root, trigonometric functions).
* **User interface:** Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive experience.
* **Calculator history:** Store previous calculations for reference.

**This project provides a solid foundation for understanding basic Java programming concepts and input/output operations.**
